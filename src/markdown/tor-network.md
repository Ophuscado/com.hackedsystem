# Tor network

Anonymous access via a hidden service is available.

## How does it work?

Tor is a free piece of software used to browse the Internet anonymously. To connect via our hidden service on Tor, you can download the [Tor Browser for Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows](https://www.torproject.org/download/), or the [Onion Browser for Apple mobile devices.](https://onionbrowser.com/)

After you got it, you will notice the name was right. It is a browser, but anonymous. Now you can start exploring as usual and your IP will be hidden by multiple layers of technology. Another difference you will notice are the links ending in the word "onion", and replacing the usual ".com" termination. Those are used for accessing hidden services.

The use of Tor to access our services is completely optional, but it may bring security benefits in some cases.
